/*
Old View syntax
Array Views: [T]:& (non owning), [T]:&mut (non owning mut), [T]:^ gc view
Same for string and interface views
*/
// New Syntax 1
// all views are of the form [T]:. then they can be borrowed like &[T]:.
// so the type [T]:. would exist as a non concrete type (similarly to interfaces)
// this would allow universal constraints for operation like borrow
operator: &(obj: &T) -> &R
operator: &mut (obj: &mut T) -> &mut R
// as opposed to
operator: &(obj: &T) -> (&R or [R]:&)
